Introduction
------------

This lab is split into three parts. The first part concentrates on
getting familiarized with x86 assembly language, the QEMU x86 emulator,
and the PC's power-on bootstrap procedure. The second part examines the
boot loader for our 6.828 kernel, which resides in the `boot` directory
of the `lab` tree. Finally, the third part delves into the initial
template for our 6.828 kernel itself, named JOS, which resides in the
`kernel` directory.

### Software Setup

The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in this
course are distributed using the [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) version
control system. To learn more about Git, take a look at the [Git user's
manual](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html),
or, if you are already familiar with other version control systems, you
may find this [CS-oriented overview of
Git](http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/) useful.

The URL for the course Git repository is
`https://exokernel.scripts.mit.edu/joslab.git`.
To install the files in your Athena account, you need to *clone* the
course repository, by running the commands below. You must use an i386
Athena machine; that is, `uname -a` should mention `i386 GNU/Linux` or
`i686 GNU/Linux`. You can log into a public i386 Athena host with
`ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu`.

```lang-sh
athena% mkdir ~/6.828
athena% cd ~/6.828
athena% add git
athena% git clone https://exokernel.scripts.mit.edu/joslab.git lab
Cloning into lab...
athena% cd lab
athena%
```

Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code. For
example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want to
checkpoint your progress, you can *commit* your changes by running:

```lang-sh
athena% git commit -am 'my solution for lab1 exercise 9'
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for lab1 exercise 9
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
athena%
```

You can keep track of your changes by using the `git diff` command.
Running `git diff` will display the changes to your code since your last
commit, and `git diff origin/lab1` will display the changes relative to
the initial code supplied for this lab. Here, `origin/lab1` is the name
of the git branch with the initial code you downloaded from our server
for this assignment.

We have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on
Athena. To use them, run `add exokernel`. You must run this command every
time you log in (or add it to your `~/.environment` file). If you get
obscure errors while compiling or running `qemu`, double check that you
added the course locker.

If you are working on a non-Athena machine, you'll need to install
`qemu` and possibly `gcc` following the directions on the [tools
page](../../tools). We've made several useful debugging changes to
`qemu` and some of the later labs depend on these patches, so you must
build your own. If your machine uses a native ELF toolchain (such as
Linux and most BSD's, but notably *not* OS X), you can simply install
`gcc` from your package manager. Otherwise, follow the directions on the
tools page.

### Hand-In Procedure

We use different Git repositories for you to hand in your lab. The
hand-in repositories reside behind an SSH server. You will get your own
hand-in repository, which is inaccessible by any other students. To
authenticate yourself with the SSH server, you should have an RSA key
pair, and let the server know your public key.

The lab code comes with a script that helps you to set up access to your
hand-in repository. Before running the script, you must have an account
at our [submission web interface](https://exokernel.scripts.mit.edu/submit/). On the login page,
type in your Athena user name and click on "Mail me my password". You
will receive your `6.828` password in your mailbox shortly. Note that
every time you click the button, the system will assign you a new random
password.

Now that you have your `6.828` password, in the `lab` directory, set up
the hand-in repository by running:

```lang-sh
athena% make handin-prep
Using public key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD0lnnkoHSi4JDFA ...
Continue? [Y/n] Y

Login to 6.828 submission website.
If you do not have an account yet, sign up at https://exokernel.scripts.mit.edu/submit/
before continuing.
Username: <your Athena username>
Password: <your 6.828 password>
Your public key has been successfully updated.
Setting up hand-in Git repository...
Adding remote repository ssh://josgit@exokernel.mit.edu/joslab.git as 'handin'.
Done! Use 'make handin' to submit your lab code.
athena%
```

The script may also ask you to generate a new key pair if you did not
have one:

```lang-sh
athena% make handin-prep
SSH key file ~/.ssh/id_rsa does not exists, generate one? [Y/n] Y
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
The keyÊ¼s randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|    ........     |
|    ........     |
+-----------------+
Using public key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD0lnnkoHSi4JDFA ...
Continue? [Y/n] Y
.....
athena%
```

When you are ready to hand in your lab, first commit your changes with
git commit, and then type make handin in the `lab` directory. The latter
will run git push handin HEAD, which pushes the current branch to the
same name on the remote `handin` repository.

```lang-sh
athena% git commit -am "ready to submit my lab"
[lab1 c2e3c8b] ready to submit my lab
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

athena% make handin
Handin to remote repository using 'git push handin HEAD' ...
Counting objects: 59, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (55/55), done.
Writing objects: 100% (59/59), 49.75 KiB, done.
Total 59 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)
To ssh://josgit@am.csail.mit.edu/joslab.git
 * [new branch]      HEAD -> lab1
athena%
```

If you have made changes to your hand-in repository, an email receipt
will be sent to you to confirm the submission. You can run make handin
(or git push handin) as many times as you want. The late hours of your
submission for a specific lab is based on the latest hand-in (push) time
of the corresponding branch.

In the case that make handin does not work properly, try fixing the
problem with Git commands. Or you can run make tarball. This will make a
tar file for you, which you can then upload via our [web
interface](https://exokernel.scripts.mit.edu/submit/). `make handin` provides more specific
directions.

For Lab 1, you do not need to turn in answers to any of the questions
below. (Do answer them for yourself though! They will help with the rest
of the lab.)

We will be grading your solutions with a grading program. You can run
make grade to test your solutions with the grading program.

Part 1: PC Bootstrap
--------------------

The purpose of the first exercise is to introduce you to x86 assembly
language and the PC bootstrap process, and to get you started with QEMU
and QEMU/GDB debugging. You will not have to write any code for this
part of the lab, but you should go through it anyway for your own
understanding and be prepared to answer the questions posed below.

### Getting Started with x86 assembly

If you are not already familiar with x86 assembly language, you will
quickly become familiar with it during this course! The [PC Assembly
Language Book](../../readings/pcasm-book.pdf) is an excellent place to
start. Hopefully, the book contains mixture of new and old material for
you.

*Warning:* Unfortunately the examples in the book are written for the
NASM assembler, whereas we will be using the GNU assembler. NASM uses
the so-called *Intel* syntax while GNU uses the *AT&T* syntax. While
semantically equivalent, an assembly file will differ quite a lot, at
least superficially, depending on which syntax is used. Luckily the
conversion between the two is pretty simple, and is covered in
[Brennan's Guide to Inline
Assembly](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html).

> **Exercise 1**

> Familiarize yourself with the assembly language materials available
> on [the 6.828 reference page](../../reference). You don't have
> to read them now, but you'll almost certainly want to refer to some
> of this material when reading and writing x86 assembly.

We do recommend reading the section "The Syntax" in [Brennan's Guide to
Inline
Assembly](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html).
It gives a good (and quite brief) description of the AT&T assembly
syntax we'll be using with the GNU assembler in JOS.

Certainly the definitive reference for x86 assembly language programming
is Intel's instruction set architecture reference, which you can find on
[the 6.828 reference page](../../reference) in two flavors: an HTML
edition of the old [80386 Programmer's Reference
Manual](../../readings/i386/toc.htm), which is much shorter and easier
to navigate than more recent manuals but describes all of the x86
processor features that we will make use of in 6.828; and the full,
latest and greatest [IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's
Manuals](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html)
from Intel, covering all the features of the most recent processors that
we won't need in class but you may be interested in learning about. An
equivalent (and often friendlier) set of manuals is [available from
AMD](http://developer.amd.com/documentation/guides/Pages/default.aspx#manuals).
Save the Intel/AMD architecture manuals for later or use them for
reference when you want to look up the definitive explanation of a
particular processor feature or instruction.

### Simulating the x86

Instead of developing the operating system on a real, physical personal
computer (PC), we use a program that faithfully emulates a complete PC:
the code you write for the emulator will boot on a real PC too. Using an
emulator simplifies debugging; you can, for example, set break points
inside of the emulated x86, which is difficult to do with the silicon
version of an x86.

In 6.828 we will use the [QEMU Emulator](http://www.qemu.org/), a modern
and relatively fast emulator. While QEMU's built-in monitor provides
only limited debugging support, QEMU can act as a remote debugging
target for the [GNU debugger](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (GDB),
which we'll use in this lab to step through the early boot process.

To get started, extract the Lab 1 files into your own directory on
Athena as described above in "Software Setup", then type make (or gmake
on BSD systems) in the `lab` directory to build the minimal 6.828 boot
loader and kernel you will start with. (It's a little generous to call
the code we're running here a "kernel," but we'll flesh it out
throughout the semester.)

```lang-sh
athena% cd lab
athena% make
+ as kern/entry.S
+ cc kern/init.c
+ cc kern/console.c
+ cc kern/monitor.c
+ cc kern/printf.c
+ cc lib/printfmt.c
+ cc lib/readline.c
+ cc lib/string.c
+ ld obj/kern/kernel
+ as boot/boot.S
+ cc -Os boot/main.c
+ ld boot/boot
boot block is 414 bytes (max 510)
+ mk obj/kern/kernel.img
```

(If you get errors like "undefined reference to \`\_\_udivdi3'", you
probably don't have the 32-bit gcc multilib. If you're running Debian or
Ubuntu, try installing the gcc-multilib package.)

Now you're ready to run QEMU, supplying the file `obj/kern/kernel.img`,
created above, as the contents of the emulated PC's "virtual hard disk."
This hard disk image contains both our boot loader (`obj/boot/boot`) and
our kernel (`obj/kernel`).

```lang-sh
athena% make qemu
```

This executes QEMU with the options required to set the hard disk and
direct serial port output to the terminal. Some text should appear in
the QEMU window:

```lang-html
Booting from Hard Disk...
6828 decimal is XXX octal!
entering test_backtrace 5
entering test_backtrace 4
entering test_backtrace 3
entering test_backtrace 2
entering test_backtrace 1
entering test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 1
leaving test_backtrace 2
leaving test_backtrace 3
leaving test_backtrace 4
leaving test_backtrace 5
Welcome to the JOS kernel monitor!
Type 'help' for a list of commands.
K>
```

Everything after '`Booting from Hard Disk...`' was printed by our
skeletal JOS kernel; the `K>` is the prompt printed by the small
*monitor*, or interactive control program, that we've included in the
kernel. These lines printed by the kernel will also appear in the
regular shell window from which you ran QEMU. This is because for
testing and lab grading purposes we have set up the JOS kernel to write
its console output not only to the virtual VGA display (as seen in the
QEMU window), but also to the simulated PC's virtual serial port, which
QEMU in turn outputs to its own standard output. Likewise, the JOS
kernel will take input from both the keyboard and the serial port, so
you can give it commands in either the VGA display window or the
terminal running QEMU. Alternatively, you can use the serial console
without the virtual VGA by running make qemu-nox. This may be convenient
if you are SSH'd into an Athena dialup.

There are only two commands you can give to the kernel monitor, `help`
and `kerninfo`.

```lang-html
K> help
help - display this list of commands
kerninfo - display information about the kernel
K> kerninfo
Special kernel symbols:
  entry  f010000c (virt)  0010000c (phys)
  etext  f0101a75 (virt)  00101a75 (phys)
  edata  f0112300 (virt)  00112300 (phys)
  end    f0112960 (virt)  00112960 (phys)
Kernel executable memory footprint: 75KB
K>
```

The `help` command is obvious, and we will shortly discuss the meaning
of what the `kerninfo` command prints. Although simple, it's important
to note that this kernel monitor is running "directly" on the "raw
(virtual) hardware" of the simulated PC. This means that you should be
able to copy the contents of `obj/kern/kernel.img` onto the first few
sectors of a *real* hard disk, insert that hard disk into a real PC,
turn it on, and see exactly the same thing on the PC's real screen as
you did above in the QEMU window. (We don't recommend you do this on a
real machine with useful information on its hard disk, though, because
copying `kernel.img` onto the beginning of its hard disk will trash the
master boot record and the beginning of the first partition, effectively
causing everything previously on the hard disk to be lost!)

### The PC's Physical Address Space

We will now dive into a bit more detail about how a PC starts up. A PC's
physical address space is hard-wired to have the following general
layout:

```lang-html
+------------------+  <- 0xFFFFFFFF (4GB)
|      32-bit      |
|  memory mapped   |
|     devices      |
|                  |
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
|                  |
|      Unused      |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- depends on amount of RAM
|                  |
|                  |
| Extended Memory  |
|                  |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- 0x00100000 (1MB)
|     BIOS ROM     |
+------------------+  <- 0x000F0000 (960KB)
|  16-bit devices, |
|  expansion ROMs  |
+------------------+  <- 0x000C0000 (768KB)
|   VGA Display    |
+------------------+  <- 0x000A0000 (640KB)
|                  |
|    Low Memory    |
|                  |
+------------------+  <- 0x00000000
```

The first PCs, which were based on the 16-bit Intel 8088 processor, were
only capable of addressing 1MB of physical memory. The physical address
space of an early PC would therefore start at `0x00000000` but end at
`0x000FFFFF` instead of `0xFFFFFFFF`. The 640KB area marked "Low Memory" was
the *only* random-access memory (RAM) that an early PC could use; in
fact the very earliest PCs only could be configured with 16KB, 32KB, or
64KB of RAM!

The 384KB area from `0x000A0000` through `0x000FFFFF` was reserved by the
hardware for special uses such as video display buffers and firmware
held in non-volatile memory. The most important part of this reserved
area is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), which occupies the 64KB
region from `0x000F0000` through `0x000FFFFF`. In early PCs the BIOS was
held in true read-only memory (ROM), but current PCs store the BIOS in
updateable flash memory. The BIOS is responsible for performing basic
system initialization such as activating the video card and checking the
amount of memory installed. After performing this initialization, the
BIOS loads the operating system from some appropriate location such as
floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, or the network, and passes control of
the machine to the operating system.

When Intel finally "broke the one megabyte barrier" with the 80286 and
80386 processors, which supported 16MB and 4GB physical address spaces
respectively, the PC architects nevertheless preserved the original
layout for the low 1MB of physical address space in order to ensure
backward compatibility with existing software. Modern PCs therefore have
a "hole" in physical memory from `0x000A0000` to `0x00100000`, dividing RAM
into "low" or "conventional memory" (the first 640KB) and "extended
memory" (everything else). In addition, some space at the very top of
the PC's 32-bit physical address space, above all physical RAM, is now
commonly reserved by the BIOS for use by 32-bit PCI devices.

Recent x86 processors can support *more* than 4GB of physical RAM, so
RAM can extend further above `0xFFFFFFFF`. In this case the BIOS must
arrange to leave a *second* hole in the system's RAM at the top of the
32-bit addressable region, to leave room for these 32-bit devices to be
mapped. Because of design limitations JOS will use only the first 256MB
of a PC's physical memory anyway, so for now we will pretend that all
PCs have "only" a 32-bit physical address space. But dealing with
complicated physical address spaces and other aspects of hardware
organization that evolved over many years is one of the important
practical challenges of OS development.

### The ROM BIOS

In this portion of the lab, you'll use QEMU's debugging facilities to
investigate how an IA-32 compatible computer boots.

Open two terminal windows. In one, enter `make qemu-gdb` (or `make
qemu-nox-gdb`). This starts up QEMU, but QEMU stops just before the
processor executes the first instruction and waits for a debugging
connection from GDB. In the second terminal, from the same directory you
ran `make`, run `make gdb`. You should see something like this,

```lang-sh
athena% make gdb
GNU gdb (GDB) 6.8-debian
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.  Type "show copying"
and "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i486-linux-gnu".
+ target remote localhost:1234
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:    ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
+ symbol-file obj/kern/kernel
(gdb)
```

The `make gdb` target runs a script called `.gdbrc`, which sets up GDB
to debug the 16-bit code used during early boot and directs it to attach
to the listening QEMU.

The following line:

```lang-sh
[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:    ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
```

is GDB's disassembly of the first instruction to be executed. From this
output you can conclude a few things:

-   The IBM PC starts executing at physical address `0x000ffff0`, which is
    at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS.
-   The PC starts executing with `CS = 0xf000` and `IP = 0xfff0`.
-   The first instruction to be executed is a `jmp` instruction, which
    jumps to the segmented address `CS = 0xf000` and `IP = 0xe05b`.

Why does QEMU start like this? This is how Intel designed the 8088
processor, which IBM used in their original PC. Because the BIOS in a PC
is "hard-wired" to the physical address range `0x000f0000-0x000fffff`,
this design ensures that the BIOS always gets control of the machine
first after power-up or any system restart - which is crucial because on
power-up there *is* no other software anywhere in the machine's RAM that
the processor could execute. The QEMU emulator comes with its own BIOS,
which it places at this location in the processor's simulated physical
address space. On processor reset, the (simulated) processor enters real
mode and sets CS to `0xf000` and the IP to `0xfff0`, so that execution
begins at that (CS:IP) segment address. How does the segmented address
0xf000:fff0 turn into a physical address?

To answer that we need to know a bit about real mode addressing. In real
mode (the mode that PC starts off in), address translation works
according to the formula: *physical address* = 16 \* *segment* +
*offset*. So, when the PC sets CS to `0xf000` and IP to `0xfff0`, the
physical address referenced is:

```lang-sh
16 * 0xf000 + 0xfff0      # in hex multiplication by 16 is
   = 0xf0000 + 0xfff0     # easy--just append a 0.
   = 0xffff0
```

`0xffff0` is 16 bytes before the end of the BIOS (`0x100000`). Therefore
we shouldn't be surprised that the first thing that the BIOS does is
`jmp` backwards to an earlier location in the BIOS; after all how much
could it accomplish in just 16 bytes?

When the BIOS runs, it sets up an interrupt descriptor table and
initializes various devices such as the VGA display. This is where the
"`Starting SeaBIOS`" message you see in the QEMU window comes from.

After initializing the PCI bus and all the important devices the BIOS
knows about, it searches for a bootable device such as a floppy, hard
drive, or CD-ROM. Eventually, when it finds a bootable disk, the BIOS
reads the *boot loader* from the disk and transfers control to it.

Part 2: The Boot Loader
-----------------------

Floppy and hard disks for PCs are divided into 512 byte regions called
*sectors*. A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity: each
read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size and aligned
on a sector boundary. If the disk is bootable, the first sector is
called the *boot sector*, since this is where the boot loader code
resides. When the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk, it loads
the 512-byte boot sector into memory at physical addresses 0x7c00
through `0x7dff`, and then uses a `jmp` instruction to set the CS:IP to
`0000:7c00`, passing control to the boot loader. Like the BIOS load
address, these addresses are fairly arbitrary - but they are fixed and
standardized for PCs.

The ability to boot from a CD-ROM came much later during the evolution
of the PC, and as a result the PC architects took the opportunity to
rethink the boot process slightly. As a result, the way a modern BIOS
boots from a CD-ROM is a bit more complicated (and more powerful).
CD-ROMs use a sector size of 2048 bytes instead of 512, and the BIOS can
load a much larger boot image from the disk into memory (not just one
sector) before transferring control to it. For more information, see the
["El Torito" Bootable CD-ROM Format
Specification](../../readings/boot-cdrom.pdf).

For 6.828, however, we will use the conventional hard drive boot
mechanism, which means that our boot loader must fit into a measly 512
bytes. The boot loader consists of one assembly language source file,
`boot/boot.S`, and one C source file, `boot/main.c` Look through these
source files carefully and make sure you understand what's going on. The
boot loader must perform two main functions:

1.  First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to
    *32-bit protected mode*, because it is only in this mode that
    software can access all the memory above 1MB in the processor's
    physical address space. Protected mode is described briefly in
    sections 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 of [PC Assembly
    Language](../../readings/pcasm-book.pdf), and in great detail in the
    Intel architecture manuals. At this point you only have to
    understand that translation of segmented addresses (segment:offset
    pairs) into physical addresses happens differently in protected
    mode, and that after the transition offsets are 32 bits instead of
    16.
2.  Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk by
    directly accessing the IDE disk device registers via the x86's
    special I/O instructions. If you would like to understand better
    what the particular I/O instructions here mean, check out the "IDE
    hard drive controller" section on [the 6.828 reference
    page](../../reference). You will not need to learn much about
    programming specific devices in this class: writing device drivers
    is in practice a very important part of OS development, but from a
    conceptual or architectural viewpoint it is also one of the least
    interesting.

After you understand the boot loader source code, look at the file
`obj/boot/boot.asm`. This file is a disassembly of the boot loader that
our GNUmakefile creates *after* compiling the boot loader. This
disassembly file makes it easy to see exactly where in physical memory
all of the boot loader's code resides, and makes it easier to track
what's happening while stepping through the boot loader in GDB.
Likewise, `obj/kern/kernel.asm` contains a disassembly of the JOS
kernel, which can often be useful for debugging.

You can set address breakpoints in GDB with the `b` command. For
example, `b *0x7c00` sets a breakpoint at address `0x7C00`. Once at a
breakpoint, you can continue execution using the `c` and `si` commands: `c`
causes QEMU to continue execution until the next breakpoint (or until
you press Ctrl-C in GDB), and `si N` steps through the instructions
`N` at a time.

To examine instructions in memory (besides the immediate next one to be
executed, which GDB prints automatically), you use the `x/i` command. This
command has the syntax `x/Ni ADDR`, where `N` is the number of
consecutive instructions to disassemble and `ADDR` is the memory address
at which to start disassembling.

> Take a look at the [lab tools guide](../../labguide),
> especially the section on GDB commands. Even if you're familiar with
> GDB, this includes some esoteric GDB commands that are useful for OS
> work.

Set a breakpoint at address 0x7c00, which is where the boot sector will
be loaded. Continue execution until that breakpoint. Trace through the
code in `boot/boot.S`, using the source code and the disassembly file
`obj/boot/boot.asm` to keep track of where you are. Also use the `x/i`
command in GDB to disassemble sequences of instructions in the boot
loader, and compare the original boot loader source code with both the
disassembly in `obj/boot/boot.asm` and GDB.

Trace into `bootmain()` in `boot/main.c`, and then into `readsect()`.
Identify the exact assembly instructions that correspond to each of the
statements in `readsect()`. Trace through the rest of `readsect()` and
back out into `bootmain()`, and identify the begin and end of the `for`
loop that reads the remaining sectors of the kernel from the disk. Find
out what code will run when the loop is finished, set a breakpoint
there, and continue to that breakpoint. Then step through the remainder
of the boot loader.

Be able to answer the following questions:

-   At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What
    exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?
-   What is the *last* instruction of the boot loader executed, and what
    is the *first* instruction of the kernel it just loaded?
-   *Where* is the first instruction of the kernel?
-   How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in
    order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this
    information?

### Loading the Kernel

We will now look in further detail at the C language portion of the boot
loader, in `boot/main.c`. But before doing so, this is a good time to
stop and review some of the basics of C programming.

To make sense out of `boot/main.c` you'll need to know what an ELF
binary is. When you compile and link a C program such as the JOS kernel,
the compiler transforms each C source ('`.c`') file into an *object*
('`.o`') file containing assembly language instructions encoded in the
binary format expected by the hardware. The linker then combines all of
the compiled object files into a single *binary image* such as
`obj/kern/kernel`, which in this case is a binary in the ELF format,
which stands for "Executable and Linkable Format".

Full information about this format is available in [the ELF
specification](../../readings/elf.pdf) on [our reference
page](../../reference), but you will not need to delve very deeply
into the details of this format in this class. Although as a whole the
format is quite powerful and complex, most of the complex parts are for
supporting dynamic loading of shared libraries, which we will not do in
this class.

For purposes of 6.828, you can consider an ELF executable to be a header
with loading information, followed by several *program sections*, each
of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data intended to be loaded
into memory at a specified address. The boot loader does not modify the
code or data; it loads it into memory and starts executing it.

An ELF binary starts with a fixed-length *ELF header*, followed by a
variable-length *program header* listing each of the program sections to
be loaded. The C definitions for these ELF headers are in `inc/elf.h`.
The program sections we're interested in are:

-   `.text`: The program's executable instructions.
-   `.rodata`: Read-only data, such as ASCII string constants produced
    by the C compiler. (We will not bother setting up the hardware to
    prohibit writing, however.)
-   `.data`: The data section holds the program's initialized data, such
    as global variables declared with initializers like `int x = 5;`.

When the linker computes the memory layout of a program, it reserves
space for *uninitialized* global variables, such as `int x;`, in a
section called `.bss` that immediately follows `.data` in memory. C
requires that "uninitialized" global variables start with a value of
zero. Thus there is no need to store contents for `.bss` in the ELF
binary; instead, the linker records just the address and size of the
`.bss` section. The loader or the program itself must arrange to zero
the `.bss` section.

Examine the full list of the names, sizes, and link addresses of all the
sections in the kernel executable by typing:

```lang-sh
athena% i386-jos-elf-objdump -h obj/kern/kernel
```

You can substitute `objdump` for `i386-jos-elf-objdump` if your computer
uses an ELF toolchain by default like most modern Linuxen and BSDs.

You will see many more sections than the ones we listed above, but the
others are not important for our purposes. Most of the others are to
hold debugging information, which is typically included in the program's
executable file but not loaded into memory by the program loader.

Take particular note of the "VMA" (or *link address*) and the "LMA" (or
*load address*) of the `.text` section. The load address of a section is
the memory address at which that section should be loaded into memory.
In the ELF object, this is stored in the `ph->p_pa` field (in this case,
it really is a physical address, though the ELF specification is vague
on the actual meaning of this field).

The link address of a section is the memory address from which the
section expects to execute. The linker encodes the link address in the
binary in various ways, such as when the code needs the address of a
global variable, with the result that a binary usually won't work if it
is executing from an address that it is not linked for. (It is possible
to generate *position-independent* code that does not contain any such
absolute addresses. This is used extensively by modern shared libraries,
but it has performance and complexity costs, so we won't be using it in
6.828.)

Typically, the link and load addresses are the same. For example, look
at the `.text` section of the boot loader:

```lang-sh
athena% i386-jos-elf-objdump -h obj/boot/boot.out
```

The BIOS loads the boot sector into memory starting at address 0x7c00,
so this is the boot sector's load address. This is also where the boot
sector executes from, so this is also its link address. We set the link
address by passing `-Ttext 0x7C00` to the linker in `boot/Makefrag`, so
the linker will produce the correct memory addresses in the generated
code.

Look back at the load and link addresses for the kernel. Unlike the boot
loader, these two addresses aren't the same: the kernel is telling the
boot loader to load it into memory at a low address (1 megabyte), but it
expects to execute from a high address. We'll dig in to how we make this
work in the next section.

Besides the section information, there is one more field in the ELF
header that is important to us, named `e_entry`. This field holds the
link address of the *entry point* in the program: the memory address in
the program's text section at which the program should begin executing.
You can see the entry point:

```lang-sh
athena% i386-jos-elf-objdump -f obj/kern/kernel
```

You should now be able to understand the minimal ELF loader in
`boot/main.c`. It reads each section of the kernel from disk into memory
at the section's load address and then jumps to the kernel's entry
point.

Reset the machine (exit QEMU/GDB and start them again). Examine the 8
words of memory at `0x00100000` at the point the BIOS enters the boot
loader, and then again at the point the boot loader enters the kernel.
Why are they different? What is there at the second breakpoint? (You do
not really need to use QEMU to answer this question. Just think.)

Part 3: The Kernel
------------------

We will now start to examine the minimal JOS kernel in a bit more
detail. (And you will finally get to write some code!). Like the boot
loader, the kernel begins with some assembly language code that sets
things up so that C language code can execute properly.

### Using virtual memory to work around position dependence

When you inspected the boot loader's link and load addresses above, they
matched perfectly, but there was a (rather large) disparity between the
*kernel's* link address (as printed by objdump) and its load address. Go
back and check both and make sure you can see what we're talking about.
(Linking the kernel is more complicated than the boot loader, so the
link and load addresses are at the top of `kern/kernel.ld`.)

Operating system kernels often like to be linked and run at very high
*virtual address*, such as `0xf0100000`, in order to leave the lower part
of the processor's virtual address space for user programs to use. The
reason for this arrangement will become clearer in the next lab.

Many machines don't have any physical memory at address `0xf0100000`, so
we can't count on being able to store the kernel there. Instead, we will
use the processor's memory management hardware to map virtual address
`0xf0100000` (the link address at which the kernel code *expects* to run)
to physical address `0x00100000` (where the boot loader loaded the kernel
into physical memory). This way, although the kernel's virtual address
is high enough to leave plenty of address space for user processes, it
will be loaded in physical memory at the 1MB point in the PC's RAM, just
above the BIOS ROM. This approach requires that the PC have at least a
few megabytes of physical memory (so that physical address `0x00100000`
works), but this is likely to be true of any PC built after about 1990.

In fact, in the next lab, we will map the *entire* bottom 256MB of the
PC's physical address space, from physical addresses `0x00000000` through
`0x0fffffff`, to virtual addresses `0xf0000000` through `0xffffffff`
respectively. You should now see why JOS can only use the first 256MB of
physical memory.

For now, we'll just map the first 4MB of physical memory, which will be
enough to get us up and running. We do this using the hand-written,
statically-initialized page directory and page table in
`kern/entrypgdir.c`. For now, you don't have to understand the details
of how this works, just the effect that it accomplishes. Up until
`kern/entry.S` sets the `CR0_PG` flag, memory references are treated as
physical addresses (strictly speaking, they're linear addresses, but
boot/boot.S set up an identity mapping from linear addresses to physical
addresses and we're never going to change that). Once `CR0_PG` is set,
memory references are virtual addresses that get translated by the
virtual memory hardware to physical addresses. `entry_pgdir` translates
virtual addresses in the range `0xf0000000` through `0xf0400000` to physical
addresses `0x00000000` through `0x00400000`, as well as virtual addresses
`0x00000000` through `0x00400000` to physical addresses `0x00000000` through
`0x00400000`. Any virtual address that is not in one of these two ranges
will cause a hardware exception which, since we haven't set up interrupt
handling yet, will cause QEMU to dump the machine state and exit (or
endlessly reboot if you aren't using the 6.828-patched version of QEMU).

> **Exercise 7**

> Use QEMU and GDB to trace into the JOS kernel and stop at the `movl
> %eax, %cr0`. Examine memory at `0x00100000` and at `0xf0100000`.
> Now, single step over that instruction using the `stepi` GDB
> command.  Again, examine memory at `0x00100000` and at
> `0xf0100000`. Make sure you understand what just happened.

What is the first instruction *after* the new mapping is established
that would fail to work properly if the mapping weren't in place?
Comment out the `movl %eax, %cr0` in `kern/entry.S`, trace into it, and
see if you were right.

### Formatted Printing to the Console

Most people take functions like `printf()` for granted, sometimes even
thinking of them as "primitives" of the C language. But in an OS kernel,
we have to implement all I/O ourselves.

Read through `kern/printf.c`, `lib/printfmt.c`, and `kern/console.c`,
and make sure you understand their relationship. It will become clear in
later labs why `printfmt.c` is located in the separate `lib` directory.

### The Stack

In the final exercise of this lab, we will explore in more detail the
way the C language uses the stack on the x86, and in the process write a
useful new kernel monitor function that prints a *backtrace* of the
stack: a list of the saved Instruction Pointer (IP) values from the
nested `call` instructions that led to the current point of execution.

> **Exercise 9**

> Determine where the kernel initializes its stack, and exactly where
> in memory its stack is located. How does the kernel reserve space
> for its stack? And at which "end" of this reserved area is the stack
> pointer initialized to point to?

The x86 stack pointer (`esp` register) points to the lowest location on
the stack that is currently in use. Everything *below* that location in
the region reserved for the stack is free. Pushing a value onto the
stack involves decreasing the stack pointer and then writing the value
to the place the stack pointer points to. Popping a value from the stack
involves reading the value the stack pointer points to and then
increasing the stack pointer. In 32-bit mode, the stack can only hold
32-bit values, and esp is always divisible by four. Various x86
instructions, such as `call`, are "hard-wired" to use the stack pointer
register.

The `ebp` (base pointer) register, in contrast, is associated with the
stack primarily by software convention. On entry to a C function, the
function's *prologue* code normally saves the previous function's base
pointer by pushing it onto the stack, and then copies the current `esp`
value into `ebp` for the duration of the function. If all the functions
in a program obey this convention, then at any given point during the
program's execution, it is possible to trace back through the stack by
following the chain of saved `ebp` pointers and determining exactly what
nested sequence of function calls caused this particular point in the
program to be reached. This capability can be particularly useful, for
example, when a particular function causes an `assert` failure or
`panic` because bad arguments were passed to it, but you aren't sure
*who* passed the bad arguments. A stack backtrace lets you find the
offending function.

> **Exercise 10**

> To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86, find
> the address of the `test_backtrace` function in
> `obj/kern/kernel.asm`, set a breakpoint there, and examine what
> happens each time it gets called after the kernel starts. How many

The above exercise should give you the information you need to implement
a stack backtrace function, which you should call `mon_backtrace()`. A
prototype for this function is already waiting for you in
`kern/monitor.c`. You can do it entirely in C, but you may find the
`read_ebp()` function in `inc/x86.h` useful. You'll also have to hook
this new function into the kernel monitor's command list so that it can
be invoked interactively by the user.

The backtrace function should display a listing of function call frames
in the following format:

```lang-html
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
  ebp f0109ed8  eip f01000d6  args 00000000 00000000 f0100058 f0109f28 00000061
  ...
```

The first line printed reflects the *currently executing* function,
namely `mon_backtrace` itself, the second line reflects the function
that called `mon_backtrace`, the third line reflects the function that
called that one, and so on. You should print *all* the outstanding stack
frames. By studying `kern/entry.S` you'll find that there is an easy way
to tell when to stop.

Within each line, the `ebp` value indicates the base pointer into the
stack used by that function: i.e., the position of the stack pointer
just after the function was entered and the function prologue code set
up the base pointer. The listed `eip` value is the function's *return
instruction pointer*: the instruction address to which control will
return when the function returns. The return instruction pointer
typically points to the instruction after the `call` instruction (why?).
Finally, the five hex values listed after `args` are the first five
arguments to the function in question, which would have been pushed on
the stack just before the function was called. If the function was
called with fewer than five arguments, of course, then not all five of
these values will be useful. (Why can't the backtrace code detect how
many arguments there actually are? How could this limitation be fixed?)

Here are a few specific points you read about in K&R Chapter 5 that are
worth remembering for the following exercise and for future labs.

-   If `int *p = (int*)100`, then `(int)p + 1` and `(int)(p + 1)` are
    different numbers: the first is `101` but the second is `104`. When
    adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case, the integer
    is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object the pointer
    points to.
-   `p[i]` is defined to be the same as `*(p+i)`, referring to the i'th
    object in the memory pointed to by p. The above rule for addition
    helps this definition work when the objects are larger than one
    byte.
-   `&p[i]` is the same as `(p+i)`, yielding the address of the i'th
    object in the memory pointed to by p.

Although most C programs never need to cast between pointers and
integers, operating systems frequently do. Whenever you see an addition
involving a memory address, ask yourself whether it is an integer
addition or pointer addition and make sure the value being added is
appropriately multiplied or not.

At this point, your backtrace function should give you the addresses of
the function callers on the stack that lead to `mon_backtrace()` being
executed. However, in practice you often want to know the function names
corresponding to those addresses. For instance, you may want to know
which functions could contain a bug that's causing your kernel to crash.

To help you implement this functionality, we have provided the function
`debuginfo_eip()`, which looks up `eip` in the symbol table and returns
the debugging information for that address. This function is defined in
`kern/kdebug.c`.

> **Exercise 12**

> Modify your stack backtrace function to display, for each `eip`, the
> function name, source file name, and line number corresponding to
> that `eip`.

In `debuginfo_eip`, where do `__STAB_*` come from? This question has a
long answer; to help you to discover the answer, here are some things
you might want to do:

-   look in the file `kern/kernel.ld` for `__STAB_*`
-   run i386-jos-elf-objdump -h obj/kern/kernel
-   run i386-jos-elf-objdump -G obj/kern/kernel
-   run i386-jos-elf-gcc -pipe -nostdinc -O2 -fno-builtin -I. -MD -Wall
    -Wno-format -DJOS\_KERNEL -gstabs -c -S kern/init.c, and look at
    init.s.
-   see if the bootloader loads the symbol table in memory as part of
    loading the kernel binary

Complete the implementation of `debuginfo_eip` by inserting the call to
`stab_binsearch` to find the line number for an address.

Add a `backtrace` command to the kernel monitor, and extend your
implementation of `mon_backtrace` to call `debuginfo_eip` and print a
line for each stack frame of the form:

```lang-html
K> backtrace
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f010ff78  eip f01008ae  args 00000001 f010ff8c 00000000 f0110580 00000000
         kern/monitor.c:143: monitor+106
  ebp f010ffd8  eip f0100193  args 00000000 00001aac 00000660 00000000 00000000
         kern/init.c:49: i386_init+59
  ebp f010fff8  eip f010003d  args 00000000 00000000 0000ffff 10cf9a00 0000ffff
         kern/entry.S:70: <unknown>+0
K>
```

Each line gives the file name and line within that file of the stack
frame's `eip`, followed by the name of the function and the offset of
the `eip` from the first instruction of the function (e.g.,
`monitor+106` means the return `eip` is 106 bytes past the beginning of
`monitor`).

Be sure to print the file and function names on a separate line, to
avoid confusing the grading script.

Tip: printf format strings provide an easy, albeit obscure, way to print
non-null-terminated strings like those in STABS tables.
`printf("%.*s", length, string)` prints at most `length` characters of
`string`. Take a look at the printf man page to find out why this works.

You may find that some functions are missing from the backtrace. For
example, you will probably see a call to `monitor()` but not to
`runcmd()`. This is because the compiler in-lines some function calls.
Other optimizations may cause you to see unexpected line numbers. If you
get rid of the `-O2` from `GNUMakefile`, the backtraces may make more
sense (but your kernel will run more slowly).

**This completes the lab.** In the `lab` directory, commit your changes
with `git commit` and type `make handin` to submit your code.
